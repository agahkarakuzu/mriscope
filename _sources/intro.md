# Introduction

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific inquiry, particularly relevant for data-intensive and computationally demanding fields of research, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) {cite:p}`Stikov2019-hp`. Ensuring reproducibility thus poses a unique set of challenges and necessitates the diligent application of methods that foster transparency, verification, and interoperability of research findings. 

While numerous articles have addressed the reproducibility of clinical MRI studies, few have looked at the reproducibility of the MRI methodology underpinning these studies. This is understandable given that the MRI development community is smaller, driven by engineers and physicists, with modest representation from clinicians and statisticians. In addition, given the heterogeneity of study designs and the wide range of MRI development subfields, performing a meta-analysis or a systematic review of these studies from a reproducibility standpoint is challenging. In light of these considerations, a scoping review emerges as a suitable framework for exploring the reproducibility of MRI methodology.

A scoping review aims to comprehensively map the landscape of existing research, acknowledging and accommodating the diversity in approaches and perspectives within the field {cite:p}`Arksey2005-un,Levac2010-jv,Peters2015-gk`. This method allows capturing the breadth of methodologies, exploring various analytical techniques, and identifying commonalities and discrepancies across studies. In this scoping reviewBy undertaking a scoping review, we aim to examine the current landscape of reproducible research practices across various MRI studies, drawing attention to common strategies, tools, and repositories used to achieve reproducible outcomes.
