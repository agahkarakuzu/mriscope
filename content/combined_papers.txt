3. Sharing was motivated to promote the deep learning-based processing method for CEST/AREX and to allow others to test and incorporate the approach into their research.
4. The authors encourage sharing deep learning implementations with detailed instructions for use, offering training models and suggesting that sharing with repositories like Zenodo, which assigns DOIs to shared items, could be a useful practice for future research efforts.

Year: 2020/nTitle: B1 inhomogeneity correction of RARE MRI with transceive surface radiofrequency probes
Authors: P. Delgado, A. Kuehne, João S Periquito, J. Millward, A. Pohlmann, S. Waiczies, T. Niendorf
Content:
Keywords: B1 Inhomogeneity, RARE MRI, Surface RF Coils, Quantitative MRI

Study Achievements and Reproducibility Summary:

1. The study optimized methods for correcting B1 inhomogeneity artifacts commonly caused by surface RF coils in fast spin-echo (RARE) MRI sequences at ultrahigh magnetic fields.
2. Reproducibility was facilitated by making the correction code and data openly available, so other researchers can apply the methods to their own data and benefit from improved B1 corrections.
3. The decision to share code and data was inspired by the positive practices in the field, following a trend toward transparency. The authors felt collaborating and sharing within the scientific community was not just a responsibility but beneficial for advancement.
4. The authors provide thorough documentation in their software repository to ensure the reliability and longevity of their code. They also express the importance of code sharing for the credibility of research publications and advocate for open science initiatives that reinforce the value of sharing among the MRI community.

Year: 2020/nTitle: FSL‐MRS: An end‐to‐end spectroscopy analysis package
Authors: William T. Clarke, C. Stagg, S. Jbabdi
Content:
Keywords: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Toolbox, FSL-MRS, Open-Source

Study Achievements and Reproducibility Summary:

1. The study developed FSL-MRS, a comprehensive open-source toolbox for magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis that integrates with the FSL software library.
2. Reproducibility was a focal point, achieved by sharing the FSL-MRS code as part of the wider FSL software, along with providing exemplary documentation and examples.
3. The decision to share was made early, with an understanding that transparency and accessibility are crucial for advancing healthcare research. The goals were to encourage community development and to maintain a useful archive of the research process.
4. The authors stress the importance of making academic tools open-source and believe that sharing code and data should become a standard practice that is promoted through education, training, and changing the cultural norms within academia. They also suggest that better recognition of the contribution of shared code and data could incentivize researchers to adopt more reproducible research practices.

Year: 2021/nTitle: Integration of an RF coil and commercial field camera for ultrahigh‐field MRI
Authors: K. Gilbert, Paul I Dubovan, J. Gati, Ravi S. Menon, C. Baron
Content:
Keywords: RF Coil, Field Monitoring, Ultra-High Field MRI, Spiral Imaging

Study Achievements and Reproducibility Summary:

1. The study developed an RF coil with an integrated field camera capable of concurrent field monitoring during MRI scans at 7T, improving the accuracy of k-space trajectory corrections in gradient-sensitive sequences like spiral imaging.
2. Reproducibility is achieved by sharing the design CAD files, performance data, and image reconstruction code, allowing other researchers to replicate the hardware setup and processing techniques.
3. The authors started the project with the intention to share and maintained good practices in organizing and commenting on data and code, with consistent transparency in the research process.
4. They believe sharing data and code accelerates scientific development and promotes accountability, especially when utilizing public research funds. They also emphasize the importance of fostering a culture of collaboration over competition and making science more accessible to advance the field of MRI.
