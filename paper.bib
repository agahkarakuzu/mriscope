  title     = "Vendor-neutral sequences and fully transparent workflows improve
               inter-vendor reproducibility of quantitative {MRI}",
  author    = "Karakuzu, Agah and Biswas, Labonny and Cohen-Adad, Julien and
               Stikov, Nikola",
  abstract  = "PURPOSE: We developed an end-to-end workflow that starts with a
               vendor-neutral acquisition and tested the hypothesis that
               vendor-neutral sequences decrease inter-vendor variability of
               T1, magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and magnetization
               transfer saturation-index (MTsat) measurements. METHODS: We
               developed and deployed a vendor-neutral 3D spoiled gradient-echo
               (SPGR) sequence on three clinical scanners by two MRI vendors.
               We then acquired T1 maps on the ISMRM-NIST system phantom, as
               well as T1, MTR, and MTsat maps in three healthy participants.
               We performed hierarchical shift function analysis in vivo to
               characterize the differences between scanners when the
               vendor-neutral sequence is used instead of commercial vendor
               implementations. Inter-vendor deviations were compared for
               statistical significance to test the hypothesis. RESULTS: In the
               phantom, the vendor-neutral sequence reduced inter-vendor
               differences from 8\% to 19.4\% to 0.2\% to 5\% with an overall
               accuracy improvement, reducing ground truth T1 deviations from
               7\% to 11\% to 0.2\% to 4\%. In vivo, we found that the
               variability between vendors is significantly reduced (p = 0.015)
               for all maps (T1, MTR, and MTsat) using the vendor-neutral
               sequence. CONCLUSION: We conclude that vendor-neutral workflows
               are feasible and compatible with clinical MRI scanners. The
               significant reduction of inter-vendor variability using
               vendor-neutral sequences has important implications for qMRI

              imaging to reconstruct undersampled parallel transmit field maps
              for the body and brain. METHODS: Using a combination of synthetic
              data and in vivo measurements from brain and body, 3 different
              approaches to a joint transmit and receive low-rank tensor
              completion algorithm are evaluated. These methods included: 1)
              virtual coils using the product of receive and transmit
              sensitivities, 2) joint-receiver coils that enforces a low rank
              structure across receive coils of all transmit modes, and 3)
              transmit low rank that uses a low rank structure for both receive
              and transmit modes simultaneously. The performance of each is
              investigated for different noise levels and different
              acceleration rates on an 8-channel parallel transmit 7 Tesla
              system. RESULTS: The virtual coils method broke down with
              increasing noise levels or acceleration rates greater than 2,
              producing normalized RMS error greater than 0.1. The joint
              receiver coils method worked well up to acceleration factors of
              4, beyond which the normalized RMS error exceeded 0.1. Transmit
              low rank enabled an eightfold acceleration, with most normalized
              RMS errors remaining below 0.1. CONCLUSION: This work
              demonstrates that undersampling factors of up to eightfold are
              feasible for transmit array mapping and can be reconstructed

              and no review will ever do it justice. It is full of egos and
              inventions, patents and lawsuits, high expectations and deep
              disillusionments. Rather than a paragraph dedicated to each of

              over with a coat of personal opinions and ruminations about the
              future of the field. For those unfamiliar with the Gartner hype

              expectations. Eventually the hype dies down as implementations
              fail to deliver on their promise, and disillusionment sets in.
              Technologies that manage to live through the trough reach the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Scanner upgrades due to software and hardware changes
              are an inevitable part of MR research and, without quality
              assurance protocols, can jeopardize studies. PURPOSE: To evaluate
              changes in T1 relaxation time by inversion recovery (IR) and
              variable flip angle (VFA) measurements on a 3T system that
              underwent an ``everything but the magnet'' upgrade. STUDY TYPE:
              Longitudinal. PHANTOM: An International Society of Magnetic
              Resonance in Medicine / National Institute of Standards and
              Technology (ISMRM/NIST) system phantom with repeated measurements
              across multiple (n = 3) days. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: T1 IR, VFA
              at 3T. ASSESSMENT: The T1 measurements by IR and VFA were
              compared with the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements,
              which constitute the known values for the ISMRM/NIST system
              phantom, to determine the measurement error. STATISTICAL TESTS:
              Descriptive. RESULTS: The T1 VFA measurement errors were
              distributed around zero (-15\% to +10\%) on the original system
              and then the errors were distributed entirely above zero
              post-upgrade (+5\% to 30\%). The T1 IR results had a dramatic
              increase in error distribution ($\pm$5\% original, $\pm$20\%
              post-upgrade) prior to the identification of signal saturation as
              an issue. Once the signal saturation was accounted for, the T1 IR
              errors decreased to $\pm$10\% post-upgrade. DATA CONCLUSION: The
              T1 VFA measurement differences between the original and
              post-upgrade systems can be entirely attributed to contributions
              from B1 . The T1 IR measurements demonstrate the need for
              quantitative quality assurance (QA) processes. The site under
              study passed the QA protocols in place, which did not identify
              the increased T1 error, nor the signal saturation issue. To
              improve on this study, we would make systematic, quantitative
              measurements at intervals less than a year and following any

              specific absorption rate (SAR) reduction for 2D T2 -FLAIR MRI
              sequences at 7 T by predicting the required adiabatic
              radiofrequency (RF) pulse power and scaling the RF amplitude in a
              slice-wise fashion. METHODS: We used a time-resampled
              frequency-offset corrected inversion (TR-FOCI) adiabatic pulse
              for spin inversion in a T2 -FLAIR sequence to improve B1+
              homogeneity and calculated the pulse power required for
              adiabaticity slice-by-slice to minimize the SAR. Drawing on the
              implicit B1+ inhomogeneity in a standard localizer scan, we
              acquired 3D AutoAlign localizers and SA2RAGE B1+ maps in 28
              volunteers. Then, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN)
              to estimate the B1+ profile from the localizers and calculated
              pulse scale factors for each slice. We assessed the predicted B1+
              profiles and the effect of scaled pulse amplitudes on the FLAIR
              inversion efficiency in oblique transverse, sagittal, and coronal
              orientations. RESULTS: The predicted B1+ amplitude maps matched
              the measured ones with a mean difference of 9.5\% across all
              slices and participants. The slice-by-slice scaling of the
              TR-FOCI inversion pulse was most effective in oblique transverse
              orientation and resulted in a 1 min and 30 s reduction in SAR
              induced delay time while delivering identical image quality.
              CONCLUSION: We propose a SAR reduction technique based on the
              estimation of B1+ profiles from standard localizer scans using a
              CNN and show that scaling the inversion pulse power
              slice-by-slice for FLAIR sequences at 7T reduces SAR and scan

               hierarchical k-means, fuzzy spatial c-means, and a Gaussian
               mixture model with a Markov random field prior) and an
               image-based convolutional neural network were used to segment 2
               simulated data sets derived from a public (n = 29 subjects) and
               a retrospective collection (n = 51 subjects) of hyperpolarized
               129Xe gas lung images transformed by common MRI artifacts (noise

               facilitating computational processing and providing
               discriminating clinically relevant measures of interest,
               histogram-based segmentation methods discard important

                   these models are targeted towards token- and sentence-level

              analysis and interpretation-particularly at short echo-times,
              where enhanced metabolite information coincides with elevated
              baseline interference. The degree of baseline smoothness is a key
              analysis parameter for metabolite estimation, and in this study,
              a new method is presented to estimate its optimal value. METHODS:
              An adaptive baseline fitting algorithm (ABfit) is described,
              incorporating a spline basis into a frequency-domain analysis
              model, with a penalty parameter to enforce baseline smoothness. A
              series of candidate analyses are performed over a range of
              smoothness penalties, as part of a 4-stage algorithm, and the
              Akaike information criterion is used to estimate the appropriate
              penalty. ABfit is applied to a set of simulated spectra with
              differing baseline features and experimentally acquired 2D
              MRSI-both at a field strength of 3 Tesla. RESULTS: Simulated
              analyses demonstrate metabolite errors result from 2 main
              sources: bias from an inflexible baseline (underfitting) and
              increased variance from an overly flexible baseline
              (overfitting). In the case of an ideal flat baseline, ABfit is
              shown to correctly estimate a highly rigid baseline, and for more
              realistic spectra a reasonable compromise between bias and
              variance is found. Analysis of experimentally acquired data
              demonstrates good agreement with known correlations between
              metabolite ratios and the contributing volumes of gray and white

              in these coils. Retrospective B1 correction permits quantitative
              MRI, but this usually requires a pulse sequence-specific
              analytical signal intensity (SI) equation. Such an equation is
              not available for fast spin-echo (Rapid Acquisition with
              Relaxation Enhancement, RARE) MRI. Here we present, test, and
              validate retrospective B1 correction methods for RARE. METHODS:
              We implemented the commonly used sensitivity correction and
              developed an empirical model-based method and a hybrid
              combination of both. Tests and validations were performed with a
              cryogenically cooled RF probe and a single-loop RF coil. Accuracy
              of SI quantification and T1 contrast were evaluated after
              correction. RESULTS: The three described correction methods
              achieved dramatic improvements in B1 homogeneity and
              significantly improved SI quantification and T1 contrast, with
              mean SI errors reduced from >40\% to >10\% following correction
              in all cases. Upon correction, images of phantoms and mouse heads
              demonstrated homogeneity comparable to that of images acquired
              with a volume resonator. This was quantified by SI profile, SI
              ratio (error 80\% in vivo and ex vivo compared to PIU > 87\% with
              the reference RF coil). CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates the
              efficacy of three B1 correction methods tailored for transceive
              surface RF probes and RARE MRI. The corrected images are suitable
              for quantification and show comparable results between the three
              methods, opening the way for T1 measurements and X-nuclei
              quantification using surface transceiver RF coils. This approach
              is applicable to other MR techniques for which no analytical SI
              exists.",

              MR raw data format, which promotes algorithm and data sharing.
              METHODS: A file format consisting of a flexible header and tagged
              frames of k-space data was designed. Application Programming
              Interfaces were implemented in C/C++, MATLAB, and Python.
              Converters for Bruker, General Electric, Philips, and Siemens
              proprietary file formats were implemented in C++. Raw data were
              collected using magnetic resonance imaging scanners from four
              vendors, converted to ISMRM Raw Data format, and reconstructed
              using software implemented in three programming languages (C++,
              MATLAB, Python). RESULTS: Images were obtained by reconstructing
              the raw data from all vendors. The source code, raw data, and

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Inter-scan motion is a substantial source of error in R1
              estimation methods based on multiple volumes, for example,
              variable flip angle (VFA), and can be expected to increase at 7T
              where B1 fields are more inhomogeneous. The established
              correction scheme does not translate to 7T since it requires a
              body coil reference. Here we introduce two alternatives that
              outperform the established method. Since they compute relative
              sensitivities they do not require body coil images. THEORY: The
              proposed methods use coil-combined magnitude images to obtain the
              relative coil sensitivities. The first method efficiently
              computes the relative sensitivities via a simple ratio; the
              second by fitting a more sophisticated generative model. METHODS:
              R1 maps were computed using the VFA approach. Multiple datasets
              were acquired at 3T and 7T, with and without motion between the
              acquisition of the VFA volumes. R1 maps were constructed without
              correction, with the proposed corrections, and (at 3T) with the
              previously established correction scheme. The effect of the
              greater inhomogeneity in the transmit field at 7T was also
              explored by acquiring B1+ maps at each position. RESULTS: At 3T,
              the proposed methods outperform the baseline method. Inter-scan
              motion artifacts were also reduced at 7T. However, at 7T
              reproducibility only converged on that of the no motion condition
              if position-specific transmit field effects were also
              incorporated. CONCLUSION: The proposed methods simplify
              inter-scan motion correction of R1 maps and are applicable at
              both 3T and 7T, where a body coil is typically not available. The
              open-source code for all methods is made publicly available.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: To demonstrate the application of artificial neural
              network (ANN) for real-time processing of myelin water imaging
              (MWI). METHODS: Three neural networks, ANN-IMWF , ANN-IGMT2 , and
              ANN-II, were developed to generate MWI. ANN-IMWF and ANN-IGMT2
              were designed to output myelin water fraction (MWF) and geometric
              mean T2 of intra- and extra-cellular water signal (GMT2,IEW ),
              respectively, whereas ANN-II generates a T2 distribution. For the
              networks, gradient and spin echo data from 18 healthy controls
              (HC) and 26 multiple sclerosis patients (MS) were utilized. Among
              them, 10 HC and 12 MS had the same scan parameters and were used
              for training (6 HC and 6 MS), validation (1 HC and 1 MS), and
              test sets (3 HC and 5 MS). The remaining data had different scan
              parameters and were applied to exam effects of the scan
              parameters. The network results were compared with those of
              conventional MWI in the white matter mask and regions of

              showing averaged normalized root-mean-squared error under 3\% for
              MWF and 0.4\% for GMT2,IEW in the white matter mask of the test
              set. In the region of interest analysis, the differences between
              ANNs and conventional MWI were less than 0.1\% in MWF and 0.1 ms
              in GMT2,IEW (no statistical difference and R2 > 0.97). Datasets
              with different scan parameters showed increased errors. The
              average processing time was 0.68 s in ANNs, gaining 11,702 times
              acceleration in the computational speed (conventional MWI: 7,958

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: Inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) is an
               emerging form of MRI contrast that may offer high specificity
               for myelinated tissue. Existing ihMT and pulsed MT sequences
               often use separate radiofrequency pulses for saturation and
               signal excitation. This study investigates the use of
               nonselective multiband radiofrequency pulses for simultaneous
               off-resonance saturation and on-resonance excitation
               specifically for generation of ihMT contrast within rapid
               steady-state pulse sequences. THEORY AND METHODS: A matrix-based
               signal modeling approach was developed and applied for both
               balanced steady state free precession and spoiled gradient echo
               sequences, accounting specifically for multiband pulses. Phantom
               experiments were performed using a combination of balanced
               steady state free precession and spoiled gradient echo
               sequences, and compared with model fits. A human brain imaging
               exam was performed using balanced steady state free precession
               sequences to demonstrate the achieved contrast. RESULTS: A
               simple signal model derived assuming instantaneous
               radiofrequency pulses was shown to agree well with full
               integration of the governing equations and provided fits to
               phantom data for materials with strong ihMT contrast (PL161 root
               mean square error = 0.9\%, and hair conditioner root mean square
               error = 2.4\%). In vivo ihMT ratio images showed the expected
               white matter contrast that has been seen by other ihMT
               investigations, and the observed ihMT ratios corresponded well
               with predictions. CONCLUSIONS: ihMT contrast can be generated by
               integrating multiband radiofrequency pulses directly into both
               spoiled gradient echo and balanced steady state free precession
               sequences, and the presented signal modeling approach can be

              improved spatio-temporal sharpness using randomized,
              variable-density, stack-of-spiral sampling combined with a 3D
              spatio-temporally constrained reconstruction. METHODS: We
              evaluated five candidate (k, t) sampling strategies using a
              previously proposed gradient-echo stack-of-spiral sequence and a
              3D constrained reconstruction with spatial and temporal
              penalties. Regularization parameters were chosen by expert
              readers based on qualitative assessment. We experimentally
              determined the effect of spiral angle increment and kz temporal
              order. The strategy yielding highest image quality was chosen as
              the proposed method. We evaluated the proposed and original 3D
              real-time MRI methods in 2 healthy subjects performing speech
              production tasks that invoke rapid movements of articulators seen
              in multiple planes, using interleaved 2D real-time MRI as the
              reference. We quantitatively evaluated tongue boundary sharpness
              in three locations at two speech rates. RESULTS: The proposed
              data-sampling scheme uses a golden-angle spiral increment in the
              kx -ky plane and variable-density, randomized encoding along kz .
              It provided a statistically significant improvement in tongue
              boundary sharpness score (P < .001) in the blade, body, and root
              of the tongue during normal and 1.5-times speeded speech.
              Qualitative improvements were substantial during natural speech
              tasks of alternating high, low tongue postures during vowels. The
              proposed method was also able to capture complex tongue shapes
              during fast alveolar consonant segments. Furthermore, the
              proposed scheme allows flexible retrospective selection of
              temporal resolution. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated improved 3D

               (vGRAPPA) decomposition approach for in vivo brain applications
               at 7 T. METHODS: A wideband, uniform rate, smooth truncation
               (WURST) multi-banded pulse was incorporated into SPECIAL to
               implement 2SPECIAL for simultaneous multi-voxel spectroscopy
               (sMVS). To decompose the acquired data, the voxel-GRAPPA
               decomposition algorithm is introduced, and its performance is
               compared to the SENSE-based decomposition. Furthermore, the
               limitations of two-voxel excitation concerning the multi-banded
               adiabatic inversion pulse, as well as of the combined B0 shim
               and B1 + adjustments, are evaluated. RESULTS: It was
               successfully shown that the 2SPECIAL sequence enables sMVS
               without a significant loss in SNR while reducing the total scan
               time by 21.6\% compared to two consecutive acquisitions. The
               proposed voxel-GRAPPA algorithm properly reassigns the signal
               components to their respective origin region and shows no
               significant differences to the well-established SENSE-based
               algorithm in terms of leakage (both <10\%) or Cram{\'e}r-Rao
               lower bounds (CRLB) for in vivo applications, while not
               requiring the acquisition of additional sensitivity maps and
               thus decreasing motion sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The use of
               2SPECIAL in combination with the novel voxel-GRAPPA
               decomposition technique allows a substantial reduction of
               measurement time compared to the consecutive acquisition of two
               single voxels without a significant decrease in spectral quality
               or metabolite quantification accuracy and thus provides a new
               option for multiple-voxel applications.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Implementing new magnetic resonance experiments, or
              sequences, often involves extensive programming on
              vendor-specific platforms, which can be time consuming and
              costly. This situation is exacerbated when research sequences
              need to be implemented on several platforms simultaneously, for
              example, at different field strengths. This work presents an
              alternative programming environment that is hardware-independent,
              open-source, and promotes rapid sequence prototyping. METHODS: A
              novel file format is described to efficiently store the hardware
              events and timing information required for an MR pulse sequence.
              Platform-dependent interpreter modules convert the file to
              appropriate instructions to run the sequence on MR hardware.
              Sequences can be designed in high-level languages, such as
              MATLAB, or with a graphical interface. Spin physics simulation
              tools are incorporated into the framework, allowing for
              comparison between real and virtual experiments. RESULTS: Minimal
              effort is required to implement relatively advanced sequences
              using the tools provided. Sequences are executed on three
              different MR platforms, demonstrating the flexibility of the
              approach. CONCLUSION: A high-level, flexible and
              hardware-independent approach to sequence programming is ideal
              for the rapid development of new sequences. The framework is
              currently not suitable for large patient studies or routine

  abstract = "PURPOSE: In this work, we propose that $\Delta$ B1+ -induced
              errors in magnetization transfer (MT) saturation (MTsat ) maps
              can be corrected with use of an R1 and B1+ map and through
              numerical simulations of the sequence. THEORY AND METHODS: One
              healthy subject was scanned at 3.0T using a partial quantitative
              MT protocol to estimate the relationship between observed R1
              (R1,obs ) and apparent bound pool size ( M0,appB ) in the brain.
              MTsat values were simulated for a range of B1+ , R1,obs , and
              M0,appB . An equation was fit to the simulated MTsat , then a
              linear relationship between R1,obs and M0,appB was generated.
              These results were used to generate correction factor maps for
              the MTsat acquired from single-point data. The proposed
              correction was compared to an empirical correction factor with
              different MT-preparation schemes. RESULTS: M0,appB was highly
              correlated with R1,obs (r > 0.96), permitting the use of R1,obs
              to estimate M0,appB for B1+ correction. All B1+ corrected MTsat
              maps displayed a decreased correlation with B1+ compared to
              uncorrected MTsat and MTsat corrected with an empirical factor in
              the corpus callosum. There was good agreement between the
              proposed approach and the empirical correction with
              radiofrequency saturation at 2 kHz, with larger deviations seen
              when using saturation pulses further off-resonance and in
              inhomogeneous (ih) MTsat maps. CONCLUSION: The proposed
              correction decreases the dependence of MTsat on B1+
              inhomogeneities. Furthermore, this flexible framework permits the
              use of different saturation protocols, making it useful for
              correcting B1+ inhomogeneities in ihMT.",

              care, and the number of, and access to, primary research sources
              has grown. One of the newer review types is the 'scoping review'.
              In general, scoping reviews are commonly used for
              'reconnaissance' - to clarify working definitions and conceptual
              boundaries of a topic or field. Scoping reviews are therefore
              particularly useful when a body of literature has not yet been
              comprehensively reviewed, or exhibits a complex or heterogeneous
              nature not amenable to a more precise systematic review of the
              evidence. While scoping reviews may be conducted to determine the
              value and probable scope of a full systematic review, they may
              also be undertaken as exercises in and of themselves to summarize
              and disseminate research findings, to identify research gaps, and
              to make recommendations for the future research. This article
              briefly introduces the reader to scoping reviews, how they are
              different to systematic reviews, and why they might be conducted.

               (CF) lung disease. METHODS: Ten participants with stable CF and
               a baseline FEV1 > 70\% completed a single imaging session where
               dynamic 19 F and single breath 129 Xe lung ventilation images
               were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner. Ventilation defect
               percentages (VDP) values between 19 F early-breath, 19 F
               maximum-ventilation, 129 Xe low-resolution, and 129 Xe
               high-resolution images were compared. Dynamic 19 F images were
               used to determine gas wash-in/out rates in regions of
               ventilation congruency and mismatch between 129 Xe and 19 F.
               RESULTS: VDP values from high-resolution 129 Xe images were
               greater than from low-resolution images (P = .001), although
               these values were significantly correlated (r = 0.68, P = .03).
               Early-breath 19 F VDP and max-vent 19 F VDP also showed
               significant correlation (r = 0.75, P = .012), with early-breath
               19 F VDP values being significantly greater (P < .001). No
               correlation in VDP values were detected between either 19 F
               method or high-res 129 Xe images. In addition, the location and
               volume of ventilation defects were often different when
               comparing 129 Xe and 19 F images from the same subject. Areas of
               ventilation congruence displayed the expected ventilation
               kinetics, while areas of ventilation mismatch displayed
               abnormally slow gas wash-in and wash-out. CONCLUSION: In CF
               subjects, ventilation abnormalities are identified by both 19 F
               and HP 129 Xe imaging. However, these ventilation abnormalities
               are not entirely congruent. 19 F and HP 129 Xe imaging provide
               complementary information that enable differentiation of

              an intuitive QA document. METHODS: The proposed pipeline, built
              around the FSL, MRTrix3, and ANTs software packages, performs DWI
              denoising; inter-scan intensity normalization; susceptibility-,
              eddy current-, and motion-induced artifact correction; and
              slice-wise signal drop-out imputation. To perform QA on the raw

              pipeline documents qualitative visualizations, quantitative
              plots, gradient verifications, and tensor goodness-of-fit and

              (CV), but nonconstant absolute variance in MRI relaxometry (T1 ,
              T2 , R1 , R2 ) data leads to erroneous conclusions based on
              standard linear models such as ordinary least squares (OLS). We
              propose a gamma generalized linear model identity link (GGLM-ID)
              framework that factors the inherent CV into parameter estimates.
              We first examined the effects on calculations of contrast agent
              relaxivity before broadening to other applications such as
              analysis of variance (ANOVA) and liver iron content (LIC).
              METHODS: Eight models including OLS and GGLM-ID were initially
              fit to data obtained on sulfated dextran iron oxide (SDIO)
              nanoparticles. Both a resampling simulation on the data as well
              as two separate Monte Carlo simulations (with and without
              concentration error) were performed to determine mean square
              error (MSE) and type I error rate. We then evaluated the
              performance of OLS/GGLM-ID on R1 repeatability and LIC data sets.
              RESULTS: OLS had an MSE of 4-5$\times$ that of GGLM-ID as well as

              volumetric dynamic MRI from rapid continuous and non-gated
              acquisitions, with applications to pulmonary and dynamic
              contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. THEORY AND METHODS: The problem
              considered here requires recovering 100 gigabytes of dynamic
              volumetric image data from a few gigabytes of k-space data,
              acquired continuously over several minutes. This reconstruction
              is vastly under-determined, heavily stressing computing resources
              as well as memory management and storage. To overcome these
              challenges, we leverage intrinsic three-dimensional (3D)
              trajectories, such as 3D radial and 3D cones, with ordering that
              incoherently cover time and k-space over the entire acquisition.
              We then propose two innovations: (a) A compressed representation
              using multiscale low-rank matrix factorization that constrains
              the reconstruction problem, and reduces its memory footprint. (b)
              Stochastic optimization to reduce computation, improve memory
              locality, and minimize communications between threads and
              processors. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method
              on DCE imaging acquired with a golden-angle ordered 3D cones
              trajectory and pulmonary imaging acquired with a bit-reversed
              ordered 3D radial trajectory. We compare it with ``soft-gated''
              dynamic reconstruction for DCE and respiratory-resolved
              reconstruction for pulmonary imaging. RESULTS: The proposed
              technique shows transient dynamics that are not seen in
              gating-based methods. When applied to datasets with irregular, or
              non-repetitive motions, the proposed method displays sharper
              image features. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a method that can
              reconstruct massive 3D dynamic image series in the extreme
              undersampling and extreme computation setting.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Spatially selective arterial spin labeling (ASL)
              perfusion MRI is sensitive to arterial transit times (ATT) that
              can result in inaccurate perfusion quantification when ATTs are
              long. Velocity-selective ASL is robust to this effect because
              blood is labeled within the imaging region, allowing immediate
              label delivery. However, velocity-selective ASL cannot
              characterize ATTs, which can provide important clinical
              information. Here, we introduce a novel pulse sequence, called
              VESPA ASL, that combines velocity-selective and pseudo-continuous
              ASL to simultaneously label different pools of arterial blood for
              robust cerebral blood flow (CBF) and ATT measurement. METHODS:
              The VESPA ASL sequence is similar to velocity-selective ASL, but
              the velocity-selective labeling is made spatially selective, and
              pseudo-continuous ASL is added to fill the inflow time. The
              choice of inflow time and other sequence settings were explored.
              VESPA ASL was compared to multi-delay pseudo-continuous ASL and
              velocity-selective ASL through simulations and test-retest
              experiments in healthy volunteers. RESULTS: VESPA ASL is shown to
              accurately measure CBF in the presence of long ATTs, and ATTs <
              TI can also be measured. Measurements were similar to established
              ASL techniques when ATT was short. When ATT was long, VESPA ASL
              measured CBF more accurately than multi-delay pseudo-continuous
              ASL, which tended to underestimate CBF. CONCLUSION: VESPA ASL is
              a novel and robust approach to simultaneously measure CBF and ATT
              and offers important advantages over existing methods. It fills
              an important clinical need for noninvasive perfusion and transit
              time imaging in vascular diseases with delayed arterial transit.",

              fabricated to assess scanner performance, stability,
              comparability and assess the accuracy of quantitative relaxation
              time imaging. The phantom is unique in having traceability to the
              International System of Units, a high level of precision, and
              monitoring by a national metrology institute. Here, we describe
              the phantom design, construction, imaging protocols, and
              measurement of geometric distortion, resolution, slice profile,
              signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), proton-spin relaxation times, image
              uniformity and proton density. METHODS: The system phantom,
              designed by the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in
              Medicine ad hoc committee on Standards for Quantitative MR, is a
              200 mm spherical structure that contains a 57-element fiducial
              array; two relaxation time arrays; a proton density/SNR array;
              resolution and slice-profile insets. Standard imaging protocols
              are presented, which provide rapid assessment of geometric
              distortion, image uniformity, T1 and T2 mapping, image
              resolution, slice profile, and SNR. RESULTS: Fiducial array
              analysis gives assessment of intrinsic geometric distortions,
              which can vary considerably between scanners and correction
              techniques. This analysis also measures scanner/coil image
              uniformity, spatial calibration accuracy, and local volume
              distortion. An advanced resolution analysis gives both scanner
              and protocol contributions. SNR analysis gives both temporal and
              spatial contributions. CONCLUSIONS: A standard system phantom is
              useful for characterization of scanner performance, monitoring a
              scanner over time, and to compare different scanners. This type
              of calibration structure is useful for quality assurance,
              benchmarking quantitative MRI protocols, and to transition MRI
              from a qualitative imaging technique to a precise metrology with

              to reviewing health research evidence. In 2005, Arksey and
              O'Malley published the first methodological framework for
              conducting scoping studies. While this framework provides an
              excellent foundation for scoping study methodology, further
              clarifying and enhancing this framework will help support the
              consistency with which authors undertake and report scoping
              studies and may encourage researchers and clinicians to engage in
              this process. DISCUSSION: We build upon our experiences
              conducting three scoping studies using the Arksey and O'Malley
              methodology to propose recommendations that clarify and enhance
              each stage of the framework. Recommendations include: clarifying
              and linking the purpose and research question (stage one);
              balancing feasibility with breadth and comprehensiveness of the
              scoping process (stage two); using an iterative team approach to
              selecting studies (stage three) and extracting data (stage four);
              incorporating a numerical summary and qualitative thematic
              analysis, reporting results, and considering the implications of
              study findings to policy, practice, or research (stage five); and
              incorporating consultation with stakeholders as a required
              knowledge translation component of scoping study methodology
              (stage six). Lastly, we propose additional considerations for
              scoping study methodology in order to support the advancement,
              application and relevance of scoping studies in health research.
              SUMMARY: Specific recommendations to clarify and enhance this
              methodology are outlined for each stage of the Arksey and
              O'Malley framework. Continued debate and development about
              scoping study methodology will help to maximize the usefulness

Longitudinal reproducibility is particularly important in qMRI. The goal is to reliably quantify tissue properties that may be assessed in longitudinal clinical studies throughout disease progression or during treatment. In this work, we present the initial data release of the quantitative MRI portion of the Courtois project on neural modelling (CNeuroMod), where the brain and cervical spinal cord of six participants were scanned at regular intervals over the course of several years. This first release includes three years of data collection and up to ten sessions per participant using quantitative MRI imaging protocols (T1, magnetization transfer (MTR, MTsat), and diffusion). In the brain, T1MP2RAGE, FA, MD, and RD all exhibited high longitudinal reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient— ICC ≃ 1 and within-subject coefficient of variations— wCV \&lt; 1\%). The spinal cord cross-sectional area (CSA) computed using T2w images and T1MTsat exhibited the best longitudinal reproducibility (ICC ≃ 1 and 0.7 respectively, and wCV 2.4\% and 6.9\%).

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: To develop an RF coil with an integrated commercial
               field camera for ultrahigh field (7T) neuroimaging. The RF coil
               would operate within a head-only gradient coil and be subject to
               the corresponding design constraints. The RF coil can thereafter
               be used for subject-specific correction of k-space
               trajectories-notably in gradient-sensitive sequences such as
               single-shot spiral imaging. METHODS: The transmit and receive
               performance was evaluated before and after the integration of
               field probes, whereas field probes were evaluated when in an
               optimal configuration external to the coil and after their
               integration. Diffusion-weighted EPI and single-shot spiral
               acquisitions were employed to evaluate the efficacy of
               correcting higher order field perturbations and the consequent
               effect on image quality. RESULTS: Field probes had a negligible
               effect on RF-coil performance, including the transmit
               efficiency, transmit uniformity, and mean SNR over the brain.
               Modest reductions in field-probe signal lifetimes were observed,
               caused primarily by nonidealities in the gradient and shim
               fields of the head-only gradient coil at the probe positions.
               The field-monitoring system could correct up to second-order
               field perturbations in single-shot spiral imaging. CONCLUSION:
               The integrated RF coil and field camera was capable of
               concurrent-field monitoring within a 7T head-only scanner and
               facilitated the subsequent correction of k-space trajectories
               during spiral imaging.",

              and Lutti, Antoine and Nagy, Zoltan",
  abstract = "PURPOSE: Parametric imaging methods (e.g., T1 relaxation time
              mapping) have been shown to be more reproducible across time and
              vendors than weighted (e.g., T1 -weighted) images. The purpose of
              this work was to more extensively evaluate the validity of this
              assertion. METHODS: Seven volunteers underwent twice-repeated
              acquisitions of variable flip-angle T1 mapping, including B1+
              calibration, on a 3T Philips Achieva and 3T Siemens Trio scanner.
              Intra-scanner and inter-vendor T1 variability were calculated. To
              determine T1 reproducibility levels in longitudinal settings, or
              after changing hardware or software, four additional data sets
              were acquired from two of the participants; one participant was
              scanned on a different 3T Siemens Trio scanner and another on the
              same 3T Philips Achieva scanner but after a software upgrade.
              RESULTS: Intra-scanner variability of voxel-wise T1 values was
              consistent between the two vendors, averaging 0.7/0.7/1.3/1.4\%
              in white matter/cortical gray matter/subcortical gray
              matter/cerebellum, respectively. We observed, however, a
              systematic bias between the two vendors of
              https://doi.org/10.0/7.8/8.6/10.0\%, respectively. The T1 bias
              across two scanners of the same model was greater than
              intra-scanner variability, although still only at
              1.4/1.0/1.9/2.3\%, respectively. A greater bias was identified
              for data sets acquired before/after software upgrade in white
              matter/cortical gray matter (3.6/2.7\%) whereas variability in
              subcortical gray matter/cerebellum was comparable (1.7/1.9\%).
              CONCLUSION: We established intra- and inter-vendor
              reproducibility levels for a widely used T1 mapping protocol. We
              anticipate that these results will guide the design of
              multi-center studies, particularly those encompassing multiple
              vendors. Furthermore, this baseline level of reproducibility

              composed of three stages: (a) Consistent localization of the
              abdominal region using two 2D-Competitive Dense Fully
              Convolutional Networks (CDFNet), (b) Segmentation of adipose
              tissue on three views by independent CDFNets, and (c) View
              aggregation. FatSegNet is validated by: (1) comparison of
              segmentation accuracy (sixfold cross-validation), (2) test-retest
              reliability, (3) generalizability to randomly selected manually
              re-edited cases, and (4) replication of age and sex effects in
              the Rhineland Study-a large prospective population cohort.
              RESULTS: The CDFNet demonstrates increased accuracy and
              robustness compared to traditional deep learning networks.
              FatSegNet Dice score outperforms manual raters on VAT (0.850 vs.
              0.788) and produces comparable results on SAT (0.975 vs. 0.982).
              The pipeline has excellent agreement for both test-retest (ICC

              SAT 0.999). CONCLUSIONS: FatSegNet generalizes well to different
              body shapes, sensitively replicates known VAT and SAT volume
              effects in a large cohort study and permits localized analysis of
              fat compartments. Furthermore, it can reliably analyze a 3D Dixon

              convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accelerated MRI
              reconstruction and in several phase-based applications in
              comparison to 2-channel real-valued networks. METHODS: Several
              complex-valued activation functions for MRI reconstruction were
              implemented, and their performance was compared. Complex-valued
              convolution was implemented and tested on an unrolled network
              architecture and a U-Net-based architecture over a wide range of
              network widths and depths with knee, body, and phase-contrast
              datasets. RESULTS: Quantitative and qualitative results
              demonstrated that complex-valued CNNs with complex-valued
              convolutions provided superior reconstructions compared to
              real-valued convolutions with the same number of trainable

              data and evaluates its performance. METHODS: In May 2011, 10 male
              volunteers (age range, 29-53 years; mean, 37) underwent DW-MRI of
              the upper abdomen on 1.5T and 3.0T MR scanners. Regions of
              interest in the left and right liver lobe, pancreas, spleen,
              renal cortex, and renal medulla were delineated independently by
              2 readers. DNNs were trained for IVIM model fitting using these
              data; results were compared to least-squares and Bayesian
              approaches to IVIM fitting. Intraclass correlation coefficients
              (ICCs) were used to assess consistency of measurements between
              readers. Intersubject variability was evaluated using
              coefficients of variation (CVs). The fitting error was calculated
              based on simulated data, and the average fitting time of each
              method was recorded. RESULTS: DNNs were trained successfully for
              IVIM parameter estimation. This approach was associated with high
              consistency between the 2 readers (ICCs between 50\% and 97\%),
              low intersubject variability of estimated parameter values (CVs
              between 9.2 and 28.4), and the lowest error when compared with
              least-squares and Bayesian approaches. Fitting by DNNs was
              several orders of magnitude quicker than the other methods, but
              the networks may need to be retrained for different acquisition

              small-tip fast recovery (STFR) MRI scans for rapidly estimating
              myelin water fraction (MWF) in the brain. METHODS: We optimized a
              set of STFR scans to minimize the Cram{\'e}r-Rao Lower Bound of
              MWF estimates. We evaluated the RMSE of MWF estimates from the
              optimized scans in simulation. We compared STFR-based MWF
              estimates (both modeling exchange and not modeling exchange) to
              multi-echo spin echo (MESE)-based estimates. We used the
              optimized scans to acquire in vivo data from which a MWF map was
              estimated. We computed the STFR-based MWF estimates using PERK, a
              recently developed kernel regression technique, and the
              MESE-based MWF estimates using both regularized non-negative
              least squares (NNLS) and PERK. RESULTS: In simulation, the
              optimized STFR scans led to estimates of MWF with low RMSE across
              a range of tissue parameters and across white matter and gray
              matter. The STFR-based MWF estimates that modeled exchange
              compared well to MESE-based MWF estimates in simulation. When the
              optimized scans were tested in vivo, the MWF map that was
              estimated using a 3-compartment model with exchange was closer to
              the MESE-based MWF map. CONCLUSIONS: The optimized STFR scans
              appear to be well suited for estimating MWF in simulation and in
              vivo when we model exchange in training. In this case, the
              STFR-based MWF estimates are close to the MESE-based estimates.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: To develop a rapid and accurate MRI phase-unwrapping
              technique for challenging phase topographies encountered at high
              magnetic fields, around metal implants, or postoperative
              cavities, which is sufficiently fast to be applied to large-group
              studies including Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping and
              functional MRI (with phase-based distortion correction). METHODS:
              The proposed path-following phase-unwrapping algorithm, ROMEO,
              estimates the coherence of the signal both in space-using MRI
              magnitude and phase information-and over time, assuming
              approximately linear temporal phase evolution. This information
              is combined to form a quality map that guides the unwrapping
              along a 3D path through the object using a computationally
              efficient minimum spanning tree algorithm. ROMEO was tested
              against the two most commonly used exact phase-unwrapping
              methods, PRELUDE and BEST PATH, in simulated topographies and at
              several field strengths: in 3T and 7T in vivo human head images
              and 9.4T ex vivo rat head images. RESULTS: ROMEO was more
              reliable than PRELUDE and BEST PATH, yielding unwrapping results
              with excellent temporal stability for multi-echo or
              multi-time-point data. It does not require image masking and
              delivers results within seconds, even in large, highly wrapped
              multi-echo data sets (eg, 9 seconds for a 7T head data set with
              31 echoes and a 208 $\times$ 208 $\times$ 96 matrix size).
              CONCLUSION: Overall, ROMEO was both faster and more accurate than
              PRELUDE and BEST PATH, delivering exact results within seconds,
              which is well below typical image acquisition times, enabling

               open-source MRS analysis toolbox. It provides spectroscopic data
               conversion, preprocessing, spectral simulation, fitting,
               quantitation, and visualization. METHODS: The FSL-MRS package is
               modular. Its programs operate on data in a standard format
               (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative [NIfTI]) capable
               of storing single-voxel and multivoxel spectroscopy, including
               spatial orientation information. The FSL-MRS toolbox includes
               tools for preprocessing of raw spectroscopy data, including coil
               combination, frequency and phase alignment, and filtering. A
               density matrix simulation program is supplied for generation of
               basis spectra from simple text-based descriptions of pulse
               sequences. Fitting is based on linear combination of basis
               spectra and implements Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization for
               the estimation of the full posterior distribution of metabolite
               concentrations. Validation of the fitting is carried out on
               independently created simulated data, phantom data, and three in
               vivo human data sets (257 single-voxel spectroscopy and 8 MRSI
               data sets) at 3 T and 7 T. Interactive HTML reports are
               automatically generated by processing and fitting stages of the
               toolbox. The FSL-MRS package can be used on the command line or
               interactively in the Python language. RESULTS: Validation of the
               fitting shows low error in simulation (median error of 11.9\%)
               and in phantom (3.4\%). Average correlation between a
               third-party toolbox (LCModel) and FSL-MRS was high (0.53-0.81)
               in all three in vivo data sets. CONCLUSION: The FSL-MRS toolbox
               is designed to be flexible and extensible to new forms of
               spectroscopic acquisitions. Custom fitting models can be
               specified within the framework for dynamic or multivoxel

               approach which utilizes flexibly reusable modules. METHODS: The
               proposed sequence description contains a sequence module
               hierarchy for loop and group logic, which is enhanced by a novel
               strategy for performing efficient parameter and pulse shape
               calculation. These calculations are powered by a flow graph
               structure. By using the flow graph, all calculations are
               performed with no redundancy and without requiring
               preprocessing. The generation of this interpretable structure is
               a separate step that combines MRI techniques while actively
               considering their context. The driver interface is slim and
               highly flexible through scripting support. The sequences do not
               require any vendor-specific compiling or processing step. A
               vendor-independent frontend for sequence configuration can be
               used. Tests that ensure physical feasibility of the sequence are
               integrated into the calculation logic. RESULTS: The framework
               was used to define a set of standard sequences. Resulting images
               were compared to respective images acquired with sequences
               provided by the device manufacturer. Images were acquired using
               a standard commercial MRI system. CONCLUSIONS: The approach
               produces configurable, vendor-independent sequences, whose
               configurability enables rapid prototyping. The transparent data

  abstract = "PURPOSE: The paper introduces a classical model to describe the
              dynamics of large spin-1/2 ensembles associated with nuclei bound
              in large molecule structures, commonly referred to as the
              semi-solid spin pool, and their magnetization transfer (MT) to
              spins of nuclei in water. THEORY AND METHODS: Like
              quantum-mechanical descriptions of spin dynamics and like the
              original Bloch equations, but unlike existing MT models, the
              proposed model is based on the algebra of angular momentum in the
              sense that it explicitly models the rotations induced by
              radiofrequency (RF) pulses. It generalizes the original Bloch
              model to non-exponential decays, which are, for example, observed
              for semi-solid spin pools. The combination of rotations with
              non-exponential decays is facilitated by describing the latter as
              Green's functions, comprised in an integro-differential equation.
              RESULTS: Our model describes the data of an inversion-recovery
              magnetization-transfer experiment with varying durations of the
              inversion pulse substantially better than established models. We
              made this observation for all measured data, but in particular
              for pulse durations smaller than 300 $\mu$s. Furthermore, we
              provide a linear approximation of the generalized Bloch model
              that reduces the simulation time by approximately a factor
              15,000, enabling simulation of the spin dynamics caused by a
              rectangular RF-pulse in roughly 2 $\mu$s. CONCLUSION: The
              proposed theory unifies the original Bloch model, Henkelman's
              steady-state theory for MT, and the commonly assumed rotation
              induced by hard pulses (i.e., strong and infinitesimally short
              applications of RF-fields) and describes experimental data better
              than previous models.",
